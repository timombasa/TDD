Exercises on TDD from Kent Beck's book, Test-Driven Development. Specifically:
1.  Add two amounts in two different currencies and convert the result given a set of exchange rates 
    e.g. if rate is 2:1, 5 U.S. Dollars + 10 Swiss Francs = 10 U.S. Dollars
2.  Multiply an amount by a number of shares and receive and amount 
    e.g. $5 * 2 = $10
